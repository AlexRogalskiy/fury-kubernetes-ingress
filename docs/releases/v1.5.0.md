# Release notes


## Changelog

Changes between `1.4.1` and this release: `1.5.0`

- Refactor `dual-nginx` package to use the base of the `nginx` *(simple)* deployment.

### Upgrade path

If you already have deployed the `dual-nginx` package you should follow this procedure:

- Update `furyfile.yml` to download this release instead of the previous one.
- Run `furyctl vendor` to donwload latest changes in the `vendor` directory.
- Remove legacy components:
  - `$ kubectl -n ingress-nginx delete ds nginx-ingress-external`
  - `$ kubectl -n ingress-nginx delete ds nginx-ingress-internal`
  - `$ kubectl -n ingress-nginx delete cm nginx-external`
  - `$ kubectl -n ingress-nginx delete cm nginx-internal`
  - `$ kubectl -n ingress-nginx delete svc ingress-external`
  - `$ kubectl -n ingress-nginx delete svc ingress-internal`
- Re apply kustomize project:
  - `kustomize build . | kubectl apply -f -`

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This procedure causes downtime in the ingress feature of your cluster. If you follow this procedure
it should be less than two minutes of downtime.
