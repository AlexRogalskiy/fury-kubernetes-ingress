# Release notes


## Changelog

Changes between `1.4.1` and this release: `1.5.0`

- Refactor `dual-nginx` package to use the base of the `nginx` *(simple)* deployment.

### Upgrade path

If you already have deployed the `dual-nginx` package you should follow this procedure:


Within this repository cloned locally run:
```bash
$ git checkout v1.5.0
$ kubectl -n ingress-nginx delete ds nginx-ingress-external
$ kubectl -n ingress-nginx delete ds nginx-ingress-internal
$ kubectl -n ingress-nginx delete cm nginx-external
$ kubectl -n ingress-nginx delete cm nginx-internal
$ kubectl -n ingress-nginx delete svc ingress-external
$ kubectl -n ingress-nginx delete svc ingress-internal
$ kustomize build katalog/dual-nginx | kubectl apply -f -
```

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This procedure causes downtime in the ingress feature of your cluster. If you follow this procedure
it should be less than two minutes of downtime.

Adapt the procedure if you are using `furyfile.yml` along with `furyctl`.
